My most recent project: A bias-free, user-based annotation software for clinical radio frequency data.

This full-stack application is capable of preprocessing raw data from the database into images with different settings, annotation of the data and saving back to the database, as well as a mechanism for securing annotation accuracy and multi-purpose labeling.

Used technologies: Python, MS SQL Server
